# Week 8 Interim Report

## Fraud Detection in E-Commerce and Banking Transactions

### 1. Introduction

With the increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities in digital transactions, Adey Innovations Inc. requires robust machine learning solutions to detect fraud across e-commerce and banking domains. The project's core objective is to develop accurate and interpretable fraud detection models that can identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives to maintain customer trust. This interim report summarizes the progress on data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model development for both e-commerce and credit card fraud detection.

### 2. Methodology

#### 2.1 Data Collection and Overview

Three primary datasets were utilized for comprehensive fraud detection analysis:

**E-Commerce Fraud Dataset (`Fraud_Data.csv`):**

- **Size**: 103,316 transactions with 12 features
- **Target**: Binary classification (fraud = 1, legitimate = 0)
- **Key Features**: User demographics, device information, temporal data, IP addresses
- **Class Distribution**: 3.4% fraud rate (highly imbalanced)

**Geolocation Dataset (`IpAddress_to_Country.csv`):**

- **Size**: 138,846 IP address ranges
- **Purpose**: Enrichment of e-commerce data with country information
- **Structure**: IP range boundaries with corresponding countries

**Credit Card Dataset (`creditcard.csv`):**

- **Size**: 284,807 transactions with 31 features
- **Target**: Binary classification (fraud = 1, legitimate = 0)
- **Features**: 28 PCA-transformed features (V1-V28), transaction amount, time
- **Class Distribution**: 0.17% fraud rate (extremely imbalanced)

#### 2.2 Data Preprocessing Steps

The raw datasets underwent comprehensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency:

**Data Cleaning:**

- **Missing Value Handling**: Identified and addressed missing values across all datasets
- **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate transactions to prevent data leakage
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted timestamp columns to datetime format for temporal analysis
- **Data Validation**: Verified data integrity and consistency across all features

**Data Quality Assurance:**

- **Range Validation**: Ensured numerical values fall within expected ranges
- **Categorical Encoding**: Standardized categorical variables for consistent processing
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and documented extreme values for further analysis

#### 2.3 Feature Engineering

**Geolocation Integration:**

- **IP Address Processing**: Converted IP addresses to integer format for efficient range-based joins
- **Range-Based Merging**: Implemented `pd.merge_asof()` for optimal IP-to-country mapping
- **Data Enrichment**: Successfully merged fraud data with geolocation information, achieving 100% match rate

**Temporal Feature Engineering:**

- **Time-Based Features**:
  - `time_since_signup`: Duration between signup and purchase (hours)
  - `hour_of_day`: Purchase hour (0-23) for pattern analysis
  - `day_of_week`: Purchase day (0-6) for weekly patterns
- **Behavioral Features**:
  - `tx_count_by_user`: Transaction frequency per user
  - `txn_velocity_hours`: Time between consecutive purchases per user

**Feature Selection Rationale:**

- **Temporal Features**: Capture time-based fraud patterns (e.g., unusual purchase times)
- **Behavioral Features**: Identify suspicious user activity patterns
- **Geolocation Features**: Detect location-based fraud indicators

#### 2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Univariate Analysis:**

- **Class Distribution**: Confirmed severe class imbalance (fraud < 5% in both datasets)
- **Purchase Value Distribution**: Identified right-skewed distribution with outliers
- **Temporal Patterns**: Analyzed purchase time distributions across hours and days
- **Geographic Distribution**: Mapped transaction origins by country

**Bivariate Analysis:**

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between numerical features
- **Feature-Target Relationships**: Analyzed how features correlate with fraud
- **Cross-Tabulation**: Examined categorical feature relationships with fraud

**Key Visualizations:**

- Distribution plots for purchase values and temporal features
- Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships
- Geographic heatmaps for transaction origins
- Time series plots for temporal fraud patterns

#### 2.5 Class Imbalance Analysis and Strategy

**Problem Analysis:**

- **E-commerce Dataset**: 3.4% fraud rate (3,465 fraud cases out of 103,316 total)
- **Credit Card Dataset**: 0.17% fraud rate (492 fraud cases out of 284,807 total)
- **Impact**: Traditional accuracy metrics become misleading
- **Challenge**: Models tend to predict majority class (legitimate transactions)

**Proposed Strategy:**

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on AUC-PR, F1-Score, and Precision-Recall curves
- **Resampling Technique**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for balanced training
- **Class Weights**: Implement balanced class weights in model training
- **Stratified Sampling**: Maintain class proportions in train-test splits

### 3. Model Development and Evaluation

#### 3.1 Model Architecture

**Baseline Model - Logistic Regression:**

- **Rationale**: Provides interpretable baseline with linear decision boundaries
- **Configuration**: Balanced class weights, L2 regularization
- **Advantages**: Interpretability, computational efficiency, baseline performance

**Ensemble Model - Random Forest:**

- **Rationale**: Captures non-linear patterns and feature interactions
- **Configuration**: Optimized hyperparameters (n_estimators=100, max_depth=10)
- **Advantages**: Feature importance analysis, robust performance, handles non-linearity

#### 3.2 Data Transformation Pipeline

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**

- **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features
- **Memory Optimization**: Sparse matrices for high-cardinality features
- **Pipeline Integration**: Imbalanced-learn pipeline for consistent processing

**Training Strategy:**

- **Stratified Split**: 80/20 train-test split maintaining class proportions
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation for robust evaluation
- **Resampling**: SMOTE applied only to training data to prevent data leakage

#### 3.3 Model Performance Results

**E-Commerce Dataset Performance:**

- **Logistic Regression**: PR-AUC = 0.72, F1-Score = 0.68
- **Random Forest**: PR-AUC = 0.75, F1-Score = 0.71
